This is a Project for the logging data of Road Infrastruture which can be feed into Algorithms for different conclusions depending upon how the data is gonna be used.
A Basic idea of the project is 
Multiple Sources of data collection ------> Using Algorithms depending upon the final use case of the road data 
For example: improving route recommendation,etc
currently stale due to my insuffient skills 
will get back on it sometime later
the other file was just a test prototype of a type of data collection point
