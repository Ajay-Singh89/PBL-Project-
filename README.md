This is a Project for the logging data of Road Infrastruture which can be feed into Algorithms for different conclusions depending upon how the data is gonna be used.<br />
A Basic idea of the project is: <br />
Multiple Sources of data collection ------> Using Algorithms depending upon the final use case of the road data<br /> 
For example: improving route recommendation,etc<br />
currently stale due to my insuffient skills <br />
will get back on it sometime later<br />
the other file was just a test prototype of a type of data collection point<br />
